<p>
A few years ago I needed to learn Java. I always write a game when I'm learning a programming language. For Java I decided to make a rugby video game. In this game you play the role of a team at the Rugby World Cup. Playing is easy, on your turn you decide if you want to Run, Kick, or Pass. In addtion if you are lucky you can attempt to kick a field goal. On your turn you just push the button for your choice and see what happens. If you have a touch screen you are in for a real treat!
</p>

<p>To Play:</p>

<b>STEP 1</b> Download these two files:

<ul>
 <li> <A HREF="WorldCupRugby.jar"> WorldCupRugby.jar </A> </li>
 <li> <A HREF="teams.txt"> teams.txt</A> </li>
</ul>

<b>STEP 2</b> Double click on the jar file.

<P><b>STEP 3</b> Enjoy</P>

<p><b>Trouble Shooting</b></P>
<p> If you don't have java installed you can head over here and grab the latest version: <a href="http://java.com/en/download/windows_xpi.jsp"> Windows Java Download Page</a> . If you're on Linux you are on your own (and probably wouldn't have it any other way).</p>
<p> Make sure the teams.txt file is in the same location as the .jar file</p>
