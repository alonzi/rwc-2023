# RWC 2007
This folder contains a Rugby Video game I made over winter break in 2009 because I had to learn java.

# Setup and Play
1. Download the files
2. `~$ java -jar WorldCupRugby.jar`
**N.B.** This requires java
3. Each player selects their team
4. Press play to open the stadium window


# Rules
* One player starts the game by kicking off and then play alternates with the player in possession of the ball choosing to Run, Pass, or Kick. (or sometimes kick at goal).
* The object is just like a rugby match, have the most points at full time.
* In gneneral running is the safest move, passing is more likely to turnover, and kicking usually gives posession to the other team. However the greater the risk the more field position you are likely to gain.
